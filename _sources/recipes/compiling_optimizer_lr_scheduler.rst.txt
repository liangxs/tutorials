(beta) Running the compiled optimizer with an LR Scheduler
============================================================

**Author:** `Michael Lazos <https://github.com/mlazos>`_

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-16

The optimizer is a key algorithm for training any deep learning model.
In this example, we will show how to pair the optimizer, which has been compiled using ``torch.compile``,
with the LR schedulers to accelerate training convergence.

.. note::

   This tutorial requires PyTorch 2.3.0 or later.

Model Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For this example, we'll use a simple sequence of linear layers.

    # Create simple model
    model = torch.nn.Sequential(
        *[torch.nn.Linear(1024, 1024, False, device="cuda") for _ in range(10)]
    )
    input = torch.rand(1024, device="cuda")

    # run forward pass
    output = model(input)

    # run backward to populate the grads for our optimizer below
    output.sum().backward()

Setting up and running the compiled optimizer with LR Scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we'll use the Adam optimizer with LinearLR Scheduler
and create a helper function to wrap the ``step()`` call for each of them
in ``torch.compile()``.

.. note::

   ``torch.compile`` is only supported on CUDA devices that have a compute capability of 7.0 or higher.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-76

.. code-block:: default



    # exit cleanly if we are on a device that doesn't support ``torch.compile``
    if torch.cuda.get_device_capability() < (7, 0):
        print("Exiting because torch.compile is not supported on this device.")
        import sys
        sys.exit(0)

    # !!! IMPORTANT !!! Wrap the lr in a Tensor if we are pairing the
    # the optimizer with an LR Scheduler.
    # Without this, torch.compile will recompile as the value of the LR
    # changes.
    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=torch.tensor(0.01))
    sched = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LinearLR(opt, total_iters=5)

    @torch.compile(fullgraph=False)
    def fn():
        opt.step()
        sched.step()


    # Warmup runs to compile the function
    for _ in range(5):
        fn()
        print(opt.param_groups[0]["lr"])



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-81

Extension: What happens with a non-tensor LR?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the curious, we will show how to peek into what happens with ``torch.compile`` when we don't wrap the
LR in a tensor.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-101

.. code-block:: default


    # No longer wrap the LR in a tensor here
    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    sched = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LinearLR(opt, total_iters=5)

    @torch.compile(fullgraph=False)
    def fn():
        opt.step()
        sched.step()

    # Setup logging to view recompiles
    torch._logging.set_logs(recompiles=True)

    # Warmup runs to compile the function
    # We will now recompile on each iteration
    # as the value of the lr is mutated.
    for _ in range(5):
        fn()



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 102-104

With this example, we can see that we recompile the optimizer a few times
due to the guard failure on the ``lr`` in ``param_groups[0]``.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

In this tutorial we showed how to pair the optimizer compiled with ``torch.compile``
with an LR Scheduler to accelerate training convergence. We used a model consisting
of a simple sequence of linear layers with the Adam optimizer paired
with a LinearLR scheduler to demonstrate the LR changing across iterations.
