torch.vmap
==========
This tutorial introduces torch.vmap, an autovectorizer for PyTorch operations.
torch.vmap is a prototype feature and cannot handle a number of use cases;
however, we would like to gather use cases for it to inform the design. If you
are considering using torch.vmap or think it would be really cool for something,
please contact us at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/42368.

So, what is vmap?
-----------------
vmap is a higher-order function. It accepts a function `func` and returns a new
function that maps `func` over some dimension of the inputs. It is highly
inspired by JAX's vmap.

Semantically, vmap pushes the "map" into PyTorch operations called by `func`,
effectively vectorizing those operations.

    import torch
    # NB: vmap is only available on nightly builds of PyTorch.
    # You can download one at pytorch.org if you're interested in testing it out.
    from torch import vmap

The first use case for vmap is making it easier to handle
batch dimensions in your code. One can write a function `func`
that runs on examples and then lift it to a function that can
take batches of examples with `vmap(func)`. `func` however
is subject to many restrictions:

- it must be functional (one cannot mutate a Python data structure
  inside of it), with the exception of in-place PyTorch operations.
- batches of examples must be provided as Tensors. This means that
  vmap doesn't handle variable-length sequences out of the box.

One example of using `vmap` is to compute batched dot products. PyTorch
doesn't provide a batched `torch.dot` API; instead of unsuccessfully
rummaging through docs, use `vmap` to construct a new function:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-45

.. code-block:: default


    torch.dot                            # [D], [D] -> []
    batched_dot = torch.vmap(torch.dot)  # [N, D], [N, D] -> [N]
    x, y = torch.randn(2, 5), torch.randn(2, 5)
    batched_dot(x, y)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-48

`vmap` can be helpful in hiding batch dimensions, leading to a simpler
model authoring experience.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-67

.. code-block:: default

    batch_size, feature_size = 3, 5
    weights = torch.randn(feature_size, requires_grad=True)

    # Note that model doesn't work with a batch of feature vectors because
    # torch.dot must take 1D tensors. It's pretty easy to rewrite this
    # to use `torch.matmul` instead, but if we didn't want to do that or if
    # the code is more complicated (e.g., does some advanced indexing
    # shenanigins), we can simply call `vmap`. `vmap` batches over ALL
    # inputs, unless otherwise specified (with the in_dims argument,
    # please see the documentation for more details).
    def model(feature_vec):
        # Very simple linear model with activation
        return feature_vec.dot(weights).relu()

    examples = torch.randn(batch_size, feature_size)
    result = torch.vmap(model)(examples)
    expected = torch.stack([model(example) for example in examples.unbind()])
    assert torch.allclose(result, expected)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-82

`vmap` can also help vectorize computations that were previously difficult
or impossible to batch. This bring us to our second use case: batched
gradient computation.

- https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/23475

The PyTorch autograd engine computes vjps (vector-Jacobian products).
Using vmap, we can compute (batched vector) - jacobian products.

One example of this is computing a full Jacobian matrix (this can also be
applied to computing a full Hessian matrix).
Computing a full Jacobian matrix for some function f: R^N -> R^N usually
requires N calls to `autograd.grad`, one per Jacobian row.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-105

.. code-block:: default


    # Setup
    N = 5
    def f(x):
        return x ** 2

    x = torch.randn(N, requires_grad=True)
    y = f(x)
    basis_vectors = torch.eye(N)

    # Sequential approach
    jacobian_rows = [torch.autograd.grad(y, x, v, retain_graph=True)[0]
                     for v in basis_vectors.unbind()]
    jacobian = torch.stack(jacobian_rows)

    # Using `vmap`, we can vectorize the whole computation, computing the
    # Jacobian in a single call to `autograd.grad`.
    def get_vjp(v):
        return torch.autograd.grad(y, x, v)[0]

    jacobian_vmap = vmap(get_vjp)(basis_vectors)
    assert torch.allclose(jacobian_vmap, jacobian)

The third main use case for vmap is computing per-sample-gradients.
This is something that the vmap prototype cannot handle performantly
right now. We're not sure what the API for computing per-sample-gradients
should be, but if you have ideas, please comment in
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7786.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 111-124

.. code-block:: default


    def model(sample, weight):
        # do something...    
        return torch.dot(sample, weight)

    def grad_sample(sample):
        return torch.autograd.functional.vjp(lambda weight: model(sample), weight)[1]

    # The following doesn't actually work in the vmap prototype. But it
    # could be an API for computing per-sample-gradients.

    # batch_of_samples = torch.randn(64, 5)
    # vmap(grad_sample)(batch_of_samples)
