    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="This document is meant to highlight the syntax of the Hybrid Frontend through a non-code intensive example. The Hybrid Frontend is one of the new shiny features of Pytorch 1.0 and provides an avenue for developers to transition their models from eager to graph mode. PyTorch users are very familiar with eager mode as it provides the ease-of-use and flexibility that we all enjoy as researchers. Caffe2 users are more aquainted with graph mode which has the benefits of speed, optimization opportunities, and functionality in C++ runtime environments. The hybrid frontend bridges the gap between the the two modes by allowing researchers to develop and refine their models in eager mode (i.e. PyTorch), then gradually transition the proven model to graph mode for production, when speed and resouce consumption become critical.">
